> Spotify voting system using IoT devices.

## :book: Introduction
The Spoofy Skip Station *(SSS)* is an WoT application to be used in public and open spaces. Consider the following use case:

> Let's say you have a classroom full of students and there is an open Spotify playlist playing through the speakers. With a wooden box the students can vote to skip to the next song. If the song has an X number of "skip votes" the audio systems skips to the next song.  

> With the added control system another connected box can control the volume for the whole room.

* Voting system: Used to vote to skip the song.
* Control system: Control the volume in the room.
